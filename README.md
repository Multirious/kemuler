# `kemuler`

Welcome to `kemuler`!

This crate offers a different kind of high level input simulator framework,
utilizing Rustâ€™s type system to its full potential *(or just over-engineered)*
instead of the usual `key_down(Key)`.

Why? Combinators!

```rust
// use a simulator your heart desired
// (your heart must also implement one if there's none)
let mut s = SomeSimulator::new();

// tuple supports
(
    Key::Shift.down(),

    Key::O.click();
    Key::H.click();

    Key::Y.click();
    Key::E.click();
    Key::A.click();
    Key::H.click().repeat(5) // repeat anything before the `.repeat` 5 times,

    Key::Shift.up(),
).run_with(&mut s)
// this typed the message: "OH YEAHHHHH"
````

Currently, there are only a few amount of combinators present.
If you've got some more useful combinator, please submit an issue on [GitHub][kemuler_repo]!

# Simulators
Simulators that are being maintained by this crate.
(a simulator is just a backend)

## Enigo
**Cross-platform input simulator.**

Support for [`enigo`][enigo_repo].
This is the og crate that helpd me make this crate.

## Windows
*WIP; it is currently on the branch, `windows`.*

**Windows input simulator.**
An improvement over `enigo`'s Windows implementation.

Differences to `enigo`:
  Mouse input will work on application (mostly games)
  that uses DirectX/DirectInput/*somethingsomething*;
  that is currently not the case on `enigo`,
  see this [issue](https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo/issues/172/).

  `VirtualKey` enum's variants are more easier to search for.
  They had more intuitive names and doc aliases are added.
  More detailed documentation is also written.
